    <h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Meera Bhola</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I'm a first-year Digital Media student at UCF. I have a CS minor as well. In my free time I like to read, 
        <br>work out, play the PS5, and spend time with friends. I also practice the guitar and enjoy drawing. 
        <br>I like finding new ways to express myself creatively.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Ideally I would like to work in front-end web design or as a software developer. 
        <br>I am also interested in UX and graphic design. I have an eye for creative design and I can't wait to put these skills to good use! 
        <br>I'm excited to learn the new tools for my career path like Adobe Dreamweaver, Figma, and Google Web Designer.

        I like the digital artist linked below because her work is simple, yet elegant. She employs only one color most of the time,
        <br>yet her pieces are full of detail. She creates pencil drawings first and transforms them using PhotoShop.
